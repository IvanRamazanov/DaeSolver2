# DAE Solver 2
This program is able to construct sophisticated electromechanical systems via block diagram and to simulate its dynamics via several methods of numerical integration of ordinary differential equations.
Also you can control behavior of electromechanical circuits via using mathematical elements such as PID-regulators, Transfer functions etc.

How to build:
requires Min-GW and Qt (min-gw 14.2.0+; Qt 6.9+)
launch build.cmd

WIP roadmap:
restore all UI features from JavaFX version;
add FMI (functional mock-up interface) support.
